# Oligo analysis

Documents and scripts for generating Figures for Filges et al., "Digital Quantification of Chemical Oligonucleotide Synthesis Errors".

Now published in [Clinical Chemistry](https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvab136).

## Backwards compatibility with UMIErrorCorrect

Code used in the Clinical Chemistry paper (main branch) was adapted to raw sequencing data processed with Debarcer. The code is not compatible with data processed with UMIErrorCorrect. 

An updated version in currently being developed (devel branch), but is not currently stable.

## Required packages 

The following packages are required during the course of the analysis. 

The first code block of the R Markdown script should install these  automatically. If this does not work for one or more package, install them using their normal installation repositories.
